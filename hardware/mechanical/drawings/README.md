# Technical Drawings

This directory contains technical drawings and engineering drawings for manufacturing and documentation.

## Drawing Types

- **Part Drawings**: Individual component dimensions
- **Assembly Drawings**: How parts fit together
- **Detail Drawings**: Close-up views of specific features
- **Exploded Views**: Disassembled view showing all parts

## Drawing Standards

Follow standard drafting practices:
- ISO 128 (International) or ASME Y14.5 (US) standards
- Include title block with project info
- Add revision history
- Specify units (metric/imperial)
- Include scale information

## Required Information

Each drawing should include:
1. **Title Block**
   - Part name and number
   - Material specification
   - Scale
   - Units
   - Date and revision
   - Designer name

2. **Dimensions**
   - All critical dimensions
   - Tolerances (general and specific)
   - Datum references
   - Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T)

3. **Views**
   - Orthographic projections (front, top, side)
   - Section views where needed
   - Detail views for complex features
   - Isometric view for clarity

4. **Notes**
   - Material specifications
   - Surface finish requirements
   - Heat treatment specifications
   - Special manufacturing instructions
   - Assembly notes

## File Formats

- **PDF**: For documentation and sharing
- **DWG/DXF**: For CAD interchange
- **Native CAD Format**: For editing

## Dimensioning Guidelines

- Dimension from datum surfaces
- Use baseline or chain dimensioning consistently
- Include radius/diameter symbols (R, Ø)
- Specify thread callouts (M4 x 0.7)
- Add chamfer and fillet dimensions
- Include angle measurements where applicable

## Tolerancing

- Specify general tolerances in title block
- Add specific tolerances for critical dimensions
- Use GD&T for complex geometries
- Consider manufacturing capabilities

### Common Tolerance Classes
- **Precision**: ±0.1 mm
- **Standard**: ±0.2 mm
- **Rough**: ±0.5 mm

## Manufacturing Notes

Include information about:
- Manufacturing process (machining, 3D printing, casting, etc.)
- Material specifications
- Surface finish requirements (Ra values)
- Post-processing (anodizing, painting, etc.)
- Quality control requirements
- Inspection procedures

## Revision Control

- Track changes with revision letters (A, B, C, etc.)
- Document what changed in each revision
- Update revision date
- Maintain previous versions for reference
