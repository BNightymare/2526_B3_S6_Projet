# Assembly Instructions

This directory contains assembly instructions and documentation for putting the mechanical system together.

## Contents

- Assembly sequence diagrams
- Step-by-step instructions
- Exploded views
- Fastener specifications
- Tool requirements
- Safety notes

## Document Format

Assembly instructions should include:
1. **Parts List**: Reference to mechanical BOM
2. **Tools Required**: List of necessary tools
3. **Assembly Steps**: Numbered sequence with images
4. **Torque Specifications**: For fasteners
5. **Alignment Procedures**: Critical adjustments
6. **Testing**: Post-assembly validation

## Creating Assembly Documentation

1. Use screenshots or renders from CAD software
2. Add annotations and callouts
3. Number all components matching BOM
4. Include dimensional callouts where critical
5. Show torque values for fasteners
6. Document any special procedures

## Tips

- Start with subassemblies before final assembly
- Document the order of operations clearly
- Include warnings for potentially damaging steps
- Show before/after states for each step
- Add troubleshooting notes for common issues
- Include quality control checkpoints

## Safety

Always include relevant safety information:
- Required personal protective equipment (PPE)
- Hazardous processes or materials
- Proper handling of components
- Electrical safety (if applicable)
